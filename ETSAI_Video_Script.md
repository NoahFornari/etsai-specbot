# ETSAI Demo Video Script
**Target Length: 2:00 - 2:30**
**Tone: Casual, confident, real. Not corporate. Think "smart friend showing you something cool."**
**Format: Screen recording with voiceover + face cam in corner (optional)**

---

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

**[Screen: Etsy messages — a long back-and-forth thread between seller and buyer]**

> "If you sell custom products on Etsy, you know this screen. You just got an order for a custom necklace, and now you're about to spend the next three days going back and forth asking — what name? What font? Gold or silver? How long? And half the time the buyer takes 24 hours to respond to each message."

**[Cut — the message thread keeps scrolling]**

> "That's 15 to 30 minutes per order. If you're doing 50 orders a month, you're losing 20 hours a month just... asking questions."

---

## THE TURN (0:15 - 0:30)

**[Screen: ETSAI dashboard — clean, minimal]**

> "What if you could replace all of that with a single link?"

**[Click: paste Etsy listing URL → AI generates questions → product created in 5 seconds]**

> "This is ETSAI. You paste your Etsy listing, our AI reads it and generates the exact questions your buyers need to answer. Ring size, material, engraving text, font — whatever your product needs."

---

## THE DEMO (0:30 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Creating an order → copying the intake link]**

> "When you get an order, you create it here and get an intake link. You send that one link to your buyer instead of starting the back-and-forth."

**[Screen: Click the intake link → buyer's view of the chat]**

> "This is what your buyer sees. Clean. Friendly. No login required."

**[Screen: The AI greets the buyer, asks first question]**

> "The AI greets them by name, mentions their product, and starts collecting specs naturally — like a conversation, not a form."

**[Screen: Buyer types "I want Sarah in gold with cursive font, size 7"]**

> "And here's the magic — if the buyer gives you three answers in one message, the AI catches all of them. It doesn't just go through a checklist. It understands context."

**[Screen: AI confirms extracted specs, asks remaining questions]**

> "It confirms what it got, then asks for whatever's missing. The whole thing takes about 90 seconds."

**[Screen: Specs complete — confetti animation — completion page]**

> "Done. Your buyer is done. And on your end..."

**[Screen: Switch to seller's order detail — clean spec sheet]**

> "You get a clean spec sheet. Every answer organized, ready to go. Copy it, download it, or just read it right there. No more digging through message threads."

---

## THE SCALE (1:30 - 1:50)

**[Screen: Dashboard showing multiple orders, stats, products]**

> "It works for one product or a hundred. Import your whole Etsy shop in one click. Track fulfillment. Get emailed when specs are done. The AI even flags conversations where a buyer might be unhappy — so you can step in before it becomes a problem."

**[Screen: Settings — plan tiers, white-label branding]**

> "And on the Business plan, you can white-label the whole thing — your brand, your colors. Your buyers never see ETSAI. It just looks like your shop has a really nice intake system."

---

## THE CLOSE (1:50 - 2:15)

**[Screen: Home page — the landing page with the Hum mascot]**

> "A third of everything sold on Etsy is custom or personalized. That's almost 4 billion dollars a year. And right now, every single one of those sellers is collecting specs the same way — one painful message at a time."

> "ETSAI fixes that. Free 14-day trial. Set up takes five minutes. And your first buyer will probably finish faster than it took you to read your last Etsy message thread."

**[Screen: Sign up form]**

> "Stop messaging. Start making."
