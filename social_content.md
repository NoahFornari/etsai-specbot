### Post 1 — Pain Point (Carousel or Reel)
**Caption:**
The average Etsy custom order takes 4-8 messages over 2-5 days just to collect specs.

Not because buyers are slow. Because asking 7 questions in one Etsy message is overwhelming.

Here's what most sellers do:
1. Send a wall of questions
2. Buyer responds with half the info
3. Follow up for missing details
4. Wait another day
5. Finally start working

Here's what ETSAI does:
1. Send your intake link
2. AI chats with the buyer (friendly, one question at a time)
3. You get a clean spec summary
4. Start making

### Post 2 — Quick Tip
**Caption:**
Etsy seller tip: Stop using the personalization box for complex custom orders.

It has a 256-character limit. That's barely enough for a name and date — let alone ring size, metal type, font choice, engraving text, and chain length.

Instead, direct buyers to a separate intake form or link where each spec gets its own field.

Your buyers will thank you. Your error rate will drop. And you'll stop getting messages that say "gold ring for mom size 7 maybe 8."

### Post 3 — Before/After
**Caption:**
Before ETSAI: 6 messages, 3 days, still missing the font choice.

After ETSAI: 1 link, 2 minutes, every spec collected.

Custom orders shouldn't take longer to spec than to make.

### Post 4 — Founder Story
**Caption:**
I built ETSAI because I watched custom order sellers spend more time collecting specs than actually making things.

The average seller sends 4+ messages per order just to get the details they need. That's hours per week on copy-pasting the same questions.

So I built an AI that does it for you. You create a product, set your intake questions, and get a shareable link. The AI has a friendly chat with your buyer, collects everything, and sends you a clean summary.

No more message tag. No more missing specs. No more "what font did they want again?"

### Post 5 — Relatable Reel Idea
**Visual:** Screen recording or text-on-screen reel
**Audio:** Trending sound
**Text overlay sequence:**
- "POV: you just got a custom order notification"
- *excitement*
- "Time to collect specs"
- *opens Etsy messages*
- "Please provide: size, color, font, text, material, chain length, gift wrap preference"
- *buyer responds 2 days later*
- "gold ring for mom"
- *internal screaming*
- "There's a better way. Link in bio."

**Caption:**
Every. Single. Time. ETSAI collects all the specs for you in under 2 minutes.

## X / TWITTER

### Tweet 1 — Launch
Etsy custom orders take 4-8 messages to collect specs.

I built ETSAI — an AI that replaces all that back-and-forth with a single intake link.

Buyer chats with the AI. You get a clean summary. Under 2 minutes.

Free 14-day trial: etsai.io

### Tweet 2 — Pain Point
Etsy's personalization box: 256 characters

What custom order sellers need to collect: ring size, metal type, font, engraving text, chain length, gift box preference, rush timeline

math ain't mathing

### Tweet 3 — Build in Public
Week 1 of launching ETSAI:

- Domain: etsai.io (live)
- Blog: 6 SEO articles
- Email: welcome sequence built
- Growth engine: AI agents finding leads on Reddit
- Users: working on it

Building an AI tool for Etsy custom order sellers. The market is 2M+ active sellers.

### Tweet 4 — Tip Thread
The #1 mistake Etsy custom order sellers make:

Starting production before collecting ALL the specs.

You get excited, start cutting/engraving/assembling, then the buyer messages "actually can we change it to silver?"

Thread on how to fix your custom order process: [link to blog post]

### Tweet 5 — Quick Hit
Custom order sellers don't have a making problem.

They have an information-gathering problem.

The actual work takes 30 minutes. Collecting specs takes 3 days.

### Tweet 6 — Social Proof Setup
Question for Etsy sellers:

How many messages does it take you to collect all the specs for a custom order?

(Building a tool to get that down to zero messages)

### Tweet 7 — Comparison
Ways to collect custom order specs:

- Etsy messages: 4-8 messages, 2-5 days
- Google Forms: impersonal, breaks Etsy trust
- Personalization box: 256 char limit lol
- ETSAI: AI chat link, 2 min, every spec collected

## TIKTOK (Video concepts — record these as talking head or text-on-screen)

### TikTok 1 — The Problem (30s)
**Hook:** "If you sell custom on Etsy, you already know this pain"
**Script:**
You get a custom order. You send your list of questions. The buyer responds with half the answers two days later. You follow up. They respond the next day with two more. By the time you have everything, it's been almost a week and you haven't touched a single material. The problem isn't your buyers — it's the process. I built a tool that collects every spec in under 2 minutes. Link in bio.

### TikTok 2 — POV (15s)
**Hook:** "POV: You're an Etsy seller reading a custom order message"
**Text on screen:** (rapidly scrolling buyer message that says "hi i want a ring for my mom, gold i think, maybe silver, what sizes do you have? also can you engrave it? how long does shipping take")
**Punch:** "And this is why I built ETSAI"

### TikTok 3 — Quick Tip (30s)
**Hook:** "Etsy sellers, stop doing this"
**Script:**
Stop sending a wall of 10 questions in one Etsy message. Your buyers see that and immediately put off responding. Instead, ask one question at a time — like a conversation, not a form. Completion rates go up dramatically when you make it feel like chatting, not homework. That's exactly what our AI does — friendly chat, one question at a time, every spec collected.

### TikTok 4 — The Numbers (20s)
**Text on screen with dramatic reveals:**
- Average custom order: 4.2 messages to collect specs
- Average time to complete: 3.4 days
- Average seller time spent on messaging: 25% of working hours
- With ETSAI: 1 link, 0 messages, 2 minutes
**Caption:** Numbers don't lie. Link in bio.

## REDDIT (Comment/post angles — NOT promotional, always helpful first)

### Comment Template 1 — When someone asks about custom order process
"I do [X] custom orders a month and the biggest game changer was separating intake from production. I don't touch materials until every single spec is confirmed in writing. For the actual collection, I used to send a template message but now I use an AI chat link — buyer fills everything out in a conversation format and I get a summary. Way fewer missing specs."

### Comment Template 2 — When someone complains about buyer communication
"The personalization box is honestly useless for anything beyond a name. 256 characters for ring size + metal + font + text + chain length? I switched to sending buyers a separate intake link. You can use a Google Form or there are tools specifically built for this. The key is: one question per field, not a wall of text."

### Comment Template 3 — When someone asks about scaling
"Scaling custom orders isn't about working faster — it's about reducing the per-order overhead. For me, the biggest overhead was spec collection (4+ messages average). I automated that part and suddenly I could handle 3x the orders in the same hours."
